With cilent side routing the whole page doesnt refresh- the changes the user sees are simply changes in what is displayed. This is because the routing happens internally.
2.	Some advantages of using client-side routing is the fact that less data is processed, so itâ€™s faster. 
4. By using the word exact you can make sure that the component associated with the "/" route is not displayed for every other route. (ex.<Route path="/" component={Home} exact /> ).
